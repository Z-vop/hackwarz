## Game Speech

When we first made this game we had two very big goals in mind. To make
a game that has real life computer science and at the same time be a
super interesting exciting game. In this Game you play as a hacker
wiping bank accounts clean, spy on your enemies communications, and work
for a company where you have other types of player avatars like a
computer defense expert or the admin, along with Agents who do stuff
like spy and be lookout for other teams spies trying to infiltrate your
company undercover. Happy Hacking :)
